To do so i dont forget:

1. change State Property results to a horizontal layout instead of vertical.
    From HW7doc "In the State Properties group box, you should have three labels arranged horizontally in
       group boxes for State 1, State 2 and State Change values reported with proper units."
  
3. add "Change Values", the difference in values between state 1 and state 2, not 100% sure how to get that done yet.
      im hoping its possible to grab the calculated variables and create a seperate function somewhere in the class to
       compare the state 1 properties and state 2 properties.


Then if im not forgetting anything it should be finisihed.

To do so i dont forget:

  
1. add "Change Values", the difference in values between state 1 and state 2, to the groupbox labeled "changed values". im not 100% sure how to get that done yet. im hoping its possible to grab the calculated variables and create a seperate function somewhere in the class to compare the state 1 properties and state 2 properties.


Then if im not forgetting anything it should be finisihed.
